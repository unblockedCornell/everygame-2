 * Hello young traveler!
 *
 * There will always be dire need
 * of an adventurer to brave the dangers
 * and use his wits to escape the traps
 * and face that which others lack the 
 * power to.
 *
 * You now know and you can see it.
 *
 * It is the courage and the willpower
 * to do so, despite the fear and the
 * consequences, to pull through where
 * others would simply stop...
 * 
 * Every traveller knows that the
 * adventures never truly end.
